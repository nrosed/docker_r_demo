# docker_r_demo
Demo of how to make a docker image for old R packages

In this demo we install R 3.5.0 and some basic packages.

To run, call ./run_docker.sh

To find the correct version of R and snapshot use the following two links:
  - Rocker: https://hub.docker.com/u/rocker
  - Dates to match R version to snapshot date: https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/
